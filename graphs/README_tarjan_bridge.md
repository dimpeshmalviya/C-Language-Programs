# Bridge Edges in a Graph - Tarjan's Algorithm

## Overview
This implementation finds all critical connections (bridges) in an undirected graph using Tarjan's Algorithm. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.

## Algorithm Details

### Tarjan's Bridge Finding Algorithm
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for recursion stack and auxiliary arrays

### Key Concepts
1. **Discovery Time (disc[])**: The time when a vertex is first discovered during DFS
2. **Low Link Value (low[])**: The earliest discovery time of any vertex reachable from the current vertex
3. **Bridge Condition**: An edge (u,v) is a bridge if `low[v] > disc[u]`

### Algorithm Steps
1. Perform DFS traversal of the graph
2. For each vertex, maintain discovery time and low link value
3. During DFS, if we find a back edge, update the low link value
4. After processing all children, check if the edge to parent is a bridge
5. A bridge exists if the low link value of child is greater than discovery time of parent

## File Structure
- `tarjan_bridge_algorithm.cpp` - Main implementation with test cases

## Usage

### Compilation
```bash
g++ -o tarjan_bridge_algorithm tarjan_bridge_algorithm.cpp
```

### Execution
```bash
./tarjan_bridge_algorithm
```

## Test Cases Included

### Test Case 1: Graph with bridges
```
Graph: 0-1-2-3, 1-4, 2-5
Expected Bridges: (0,1), (1,4), (2,3), (2,5)
```

### Test Case 2: Graph without bridges (cycle)
```
Graph: 0-1-2-3-0
Expected Bridges: None (all edges are part of cycles)
```

### Test Case 3: Disconnected graph
```
Graph: 0-1, 2-3-4
Expected Bridges: (0,1), (2,3), (3,4)
```

### Test Case 4: Tree (all edges are bridges)
```
Graph: 0-1-2, 1-3, 1-4
Expected Bridges: All edges (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)
```

## Interactive Mode

1. Input custom number of vertices and edges
2. Define their own graph structure
3. Find bridges in their custom graph
