Hi — I’m Dimpesh Panwar 👋
Welcome to the C Language Programs repo for Hacktoberfest 2025! This repo is all about small, well-documented C programs that help beginners learn and contributors practice open-source collaboration.

What I’m looking for

- Follow my GitHub account ✅

- Fork this repo and create a unique Pull Request (PR) — don’t duplicate existing solutions.

- PRs with clear code, comments, and a short description are more likely to be accepted.

- Keep entries beginner-friendly and educational.

Contribution quick-start

- ⭐ Follow my account on GitHub

- 🍴 Fork this repository

- 🔀 Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/your-short-title

- ✍️ Add your C program inside a descriptive folder (example: sorting/quick_sort.c)

- 📝 Add a short README or comment at the top of your file:

- Program name

- Problem statement

- Input / Output examples

- Complexity (if applicable)

- 🔁 Commit with a meaningful message: git commit -m "Add: bubble sort with explanation"

- 📤 Push and open a PR to main with a clear title and description

- ✅ Ensure your PR is unique — check existing files before adding

- PR checklist (please include)

-  Program compiles with gcc (mention the command used)

-  File placed in an appropriate folder and named clearly (e.g., math/fibonacci_iterative.c)

-  A couple of example inputs & outputs in comments or small README

-  No duplicate solution already in repo

-  Short description of the approach in the PR body

- Style & conventions

- Use clear variable names and comments.

- Keep functions short and focused.

- Prefer standard I/O (scanf/printf) for examples.

- If your program uses advanced features, briefly explain them at the top.

Ideas to contribute

- Classic algorithms (sorting, searching)
- Number theory (GCD, prime checks)
- Data structures (linked list, stack, queue)
- Small games (tic-tac-toe CLI)
- Problem-solving examples (recursion, DP basics)
- Useful utilities (file I/O examples)

New example programs added in this branch:

- `file_io_examples.c` — shows basic file write/read using fopen/fgets/fprintf.
- `dynamic_array.c` — simple vector-like dynamic array with push and resizing.
- `linked_list_example.c` — singly linked list with insert, delete, and print.
- `bst_example.c` — binary search tree insert + inorder traversal.
