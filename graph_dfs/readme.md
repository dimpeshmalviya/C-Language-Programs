# Graph DFS Traversal

**Program Name:** Depth-First Search (DFS) on Graph

**Problem Statement:** Traverse a directed graph using DFS.

**Input Example:**  
Graph adjacency matrix:  
0 1 1 0  
0 0 1 0  
1 0 0 1  
0 0 0 1

**Output Example:**  
Starting from node 2 â†’ 2 0 1 3

**Complexity:**  
Time: O(V + E)  
Space: O(V)
